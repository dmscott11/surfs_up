## Overview
W. Avy asked us to perform analysis on local weather trends to assist in the decision making process regarding opening up their surf shop. This analysis was requested as the desire is to have a surf shop/ice cream business open year round in Oahu and in order for this venture to be a success, it is imperative that educated decisions are made.
## Results
Based on our results, it is feasible to keep a surf shop and ice cream shop open year round. There is very little difference in the mean temperatures for the months of June and December as well as only minor differences in minimum temperatures experienced in June and December.

## Summary
Overall, it has been determined that maintaining a year round surf shop/ice cream shop is entirely plausible. There may be particular days where the temperature is in the 50s in December, but for the most part, the temperature remains in a similar range to that of June
### Additional Queries
Two additional queries were performed involving precipitation and the months of June and December. This can be important to look at as no one really wants to eat ice cream when it's cold and rainy. This analysis can be found in the ```surfsup_challenge.ipynb``` file. There are no significant differences in precipitation for those months and in general, it appears that Oahu has very little rainfall overall.
